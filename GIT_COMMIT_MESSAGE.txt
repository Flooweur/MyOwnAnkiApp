Fix .apkg file import - now correctly imports all cards

Previously, importing .apkg files only showed 1 card with "Please update to
the latest Anki version" message. This was caused by the parser not properly
understanding Anki's note type system and card templates.

Changes:
- Complete rewrite of ParseAnki2DatabaseAsync() in ApkgParserService
- Added proper note type (model) parsing from Anki database
- Implemented template application for card generation
- Replaced regex-based JSON parsing with System.Text.Json
- Enhanced system message filtering
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Added helper methods: ParseNoteModel(), ApplyTemplate()
- Added helper classes: NoteModel, CardTemplate

The parser now:
✅ Imports all cards from .apkg files (not just 1)
✅ Supports Anki 2.0.x, 2.1.x, and 2.1.50+
✅ Handles Basic, Cloze, and custom note types
✅ Processes Anki template syntax ({{FieldName}}, cloze, etc.)
✅ Provides detailed logging for debugging

No external libraries required - uses built-in .NET components only.
No changes to SQL schema, API contracts, or frontend code.
